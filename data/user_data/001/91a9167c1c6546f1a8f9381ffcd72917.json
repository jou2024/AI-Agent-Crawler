I'm the founder of Iverson, a full-service creative consultancy, and co-founder of Stompers, a social step-tracking game. My career started in high school when I worked as a motion designer. Since then I've worked with dozens of startups, Square, Cash App, Rocket, Duolingo, Coinbase, Meta, and more as a designer or creative \"consultant\".\nI publish satirical product “ideas” daily (though I cut back to weekdays in 2025). Outside of work, I play bass for Dive Time and do a lil bit of investing.\nWant to say hi? Have an unhinged idea? Contact me: [EMAIL REDACTED]\nWork\nA brief professional history\nBook\nSome of my writing and design\nI wrote, designed, and published a lil coffee table book called Can you imagine? with over 365 of my satirical product ideas.\nSOLD OUT\nDesigned in Figma.
