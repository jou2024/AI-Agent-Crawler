    "content": "the idea of my career has like all of these ingredients and I took like one ingredient which is like what if this was funny and you drop it in like I think thinking about passion project side projects in that sense where it's like you don't need it to be this like massive shift where it's like oh I'm gonna go become a professional basket Weaver it's like if you if you enjoy what you do for work somewhat or if there's a component of what you enjoy doing for work identify the components that you don't like and try to remove those or if you can't identify things that you do like and see if you can basically insert them right so it's like I'm a big comedy fan outside of all of this and so it's like what if I just like that did that in this instance um and then you just pulled the thread all welcome to another episode of night investment advice we've got an ni gang here together Jack butcher trun fan below zi with a very special guest sorry Iverson welcome to the show mate hey thanks for having me on good to see you guys welcome man I Know Jack you two have already done you guys have met in real life you've done the whole you're ducked fully ducked out here we have indeed man internet Associates for a few years now s associate can we get a little bit of background we need like you got like design gurus here so for the listeners are unfamiliar with sain's work well first of all if you've been in the internet for the past six months you've seen sain's work takes like the most popular apps in the world and just totally sazesh so quick background saen uh can you just give an idea of what you're doing right now and yeah yeah so people mostly know me on the internet for the satirical app stuff I'm a designer by trade been doing it for like 10 years now started out more like graphic design stuff and then more recently product design stuff anywhere from startups to like square cash app um everything in between and now you design laughs laugh the internet Community I'm optimizing for Chuckles here's the first one this was today's post right today this is incredible I mean for just a lot of people will be listening so we just want to give them a sense of the visual because it's we always do a meme in a week and most people are only listening but yeah how would you describe this one here sain yeah so when you're using Tinder at times there's a service called Tinder gold which they will upsell you on if you like run out of matches or something I don't know I've been married for a couple years so I thankfully am not an active user but you tap on the upgrade and then there's a modal and typically it's like get more matches or whatever but in this instance you can look at the potential match and preview your future child so we have the the myself on the the left and then my potential match on the right and then in the middle there's a infant emoji with a question mark person I was gonna say is this an AI picture is this your actual wife no I would not I would not put my wife in the cont um no this is just a random unsplash photo 99% of the time I use AI generated photos because I don't want to like put people in weird situations bro you don't want that legal you don't want that that work coming to your door indicted that that actually there's a I have a funny story about that early on um but we can maybe talk about that hold on a second let's do this so I want to say one thing so block can you P the next one for the listeners because again majority of listeners but you do have a template right can you because like when I started seeing them first of all I've done really hacky like photoshops in my day and like when you start doing it I'm like damn it like the bar is so high now try get away with like these hacky like Microsoft paint jobs I'm doing but like your template tell me if this is how you think of it is you know it's very simple but it the VV is the visualized value aesthetic right is like have the template people understand it the joke's built in right so you typically have the name of the app and then you usually go but with this feature so immediately the joke's already set up right he's like it's like uh Uber but with this ridiculous feature that I'm sure people on their product team have thought about like you actually walked through how you set up kind of the joke so it's interesting because I think it started as that which was X product but with Y feature and I noticed probably a couple weeks in back in January that other people picked up on that formula and then they started doing the same thing and I was like okay that's I I love that other people were doing something similar but I wanted to try to kind of entrench my own position and so I basically evolved past the X but Y into almost introducing it as like a new feature right um and in terms of the visual design I think early on it was a lot of work because I was like taking screenshots but also like figuring out okay Uber has this custom type face I have to use that or this other company uses this like there's a free alternative it's like relatively similar then you have to like pattern match the sizing but now I basically have Micro Design Systems of LinkedIn Tinder Spotify like I have enough backlog info or like design artifacts that I can like pull those in it's like okay I had this row widget that I used in Uber and I can like change the styling and then like put it in this view on LinkedIn right so it's a design system in the non-traditional sense all right so this one was an OG one right this is a classic door Dash bite request feature but just this is a new feature because there's no butt here but was this which phase was this one so for the listeners uh uh sorry s say like for the listeners this is a it's on door Dash It's a notification and uh your door Dash delivery person ask if they can have a bite of your food which is Si so good yeah so we yeah so there's actually pre pre that concept there was a meme which was like a a very like cursed looking photo of like a person holding a b piece of chicken and it was in a text message thread and it was like I take a bite and it was like someone talking to their door Dash drive or something it was like deep on Reddit and I was like okay we know this is happening so let's just like normalize it and make it a feature and if someone's like hey can I have S youres um that one I remember we posted that uh separately I'm like I'm in a band and we're on tour and I like posted it put my phone down and then like a minute later it had like a thousand likes and I was like oh man we're going parabolic on this one it was I think those message or notification memes are so powerful because the cognitive lift is really low cuz like a really viral thing you want it to be instantly parsable and so like everyone knows what headp space to be in when they see a notification everyone's familiar with the door Dash notification and all it is is like can I have some fries it's like absolutely not so I think there's a lot of layers to making something that will go like crazy viral versus something that will maybe pop off within like a nich audience can we actually listen you're heading us right down where we need to go right right now so when you were saying the par but the the legibility is something Jack always talks about too right like I think uh tell me if you uh or any of you guys agree with this one of the canonical examples is that stupid Apple text feature right because everybody's gotten that if you post it it's the running joke is it's a guaranteed 10,000 like Banger anybody posts that this is the best apple feature which is the automatic tofa lined up as well which were the iMessage one so yeah on the same page but read this one up yeah this is uh I message honest ETA and uh Cynthia's on her way or asking about ETA and she said see you then how far away are you and they said 5 minutes but then there's a little notification it says according to Apple map cynia is still at our house 21 minutes away which is also hilarious yeah I mean we there's so many layers to this man it's so good cuz like I love the way you described you described like the the template everyone already knows that notification but then in the back of our minds we also know everyone we've sent an ETA where we're obviously not on time and so yeah it's brilliant man so good yeah walk through the layers walk through the layers dude give us give us all the alpha on on virality oh man that's uh how much time do you have I think like it's it's interesting right because like iMessage is such a universal form factor so it's like if you're if you're tapping into something that people are like I know what to expect here and then it's it's not like oh I'm redesigning this whole thing it's like I'm setting the con I'm basically writing the joke in the chat View and then you add one sentence that I think a lot of my work is just like exposing people right because there's like there's a lot of assumptions and I think when you like there's it's comedy right so the more relatable situation which is like everyone's been in a situation where like they have this friend that's perpetually late and then they're like I'm way they're like I know you're not on your way but like to make that something that is like codia not true or true um is something that Tech can do and so I think by doing that and just slightly slightly changing what's already there or finding ways to quote unquote intelligently integrate other Tech like Apple Maps right it's like you're playing on the kind of frustration um of the people have with tech just in general it's like like people don't like the fact that their phone's watching them all the time but it is so it's like let's just call it what it is and deal with it um so I think those are some of the layers here but the iMessage one is just like an infinite canvas because you can just Riff on that in so many different ways um talking of which we have a couple more I don't know how many we want to go through but these are a few cap off this one the iMessage feature yeah yeah yeah this one was good I mean the the idea of like the delivered widget or read at whatever time is just something that you can change to basically communicate any number of things like it could say oh yeah this person's heart rate spiked based on Apple Health Data they're probably lying um another one that this is actually the real Alpha it's going to get posted in a couple weeks while I'm on holiday is it shows what they save your contact name ass so um so it's just like good it's just like it's a punch line that you just you can just kind of keep changing right and then it's just a matter of like designing the conversation to to lead up to that um I think you also don't have probably my most popular one pulled up but I can describe it and it was like I made it it was kind of like chef's kiss like the perfect meme um iMessage preview that shows the length of the message that they're writing that was one I remember that one yeah I think I had that some I might have got rid of it now yeah just like a sequence of dots was it yeah yeah because normally it's like nor normally it's like oh my gosh someone's typing something it's just the three dots right but it's like you're messaging I think Kaylee is this like figure that I've architected into this like broader Cinematic Universe um but I have like I have like repeat characters now and kayle's one of them and so it's like I texted Kaylee in this world and it was like is everything okay and then it's just a wall of dots um yeah no well the classic for that line in the if you go old school meme is when you ask your wife hey is everything okay she goes yes oh actually but everything's fine but wait a second there's one thing wait so S I kind of want Jack to you guys to dabble just in general but before that I had to ask because this was something that we had chat up me and the other guys uh before you came on uh or mentioned it was like have people from these companies and these various app creators hit you up so uh I've had a lot of a lot of people that are like oh you do you like want to work on this thing or like a lot of startup Founders are like oh I'm building I'm building this and I'm like don't or like do it but differently right and then I've had uh some interactions with like I did the Instagram feature to pay to undo a deep like and apparently that was like maybe going to get built but like not have the paid tier for it I don't know um like an engineering manager was like Hey I work at insta can I like pitch this I was like sure man so I've had a few instances like that um and then I did the Uber HotBox option um and a friend texted me like yo did you see this and Reuters had to do a fact check that Uber is not offerx um so yeah I don't think that counts as like direct communication but um it's been it's people are snatching your idea you know the the ux door Dash is going into meeting like guysa is this a revenue opportunity yeah well today today there's like the guys like I designed the Tinder gold pay walls in a mad I think about this like yeah all right well you and Jack talk about uh your your previous Dianes and the this VV world like how did you guys meet up and what are some design stuff that we chat about that uh you could uh share with the audience oh man um so I found out about Jack through Micah Carroll who who was also in VV back in 2020 and then I did the whole like VV University thing um and then it interesting because like I I didn't like necessarily set that like want to build like a business or like a huge thing I just have kind of been not throwing stuff against the wall that sounds like it lacks the level of intentionality I think like I enjoy working as a designer and I'm not trying to like go out and build some huge like business for myself right now um but what I did notice through this like most current line of work is that I think similar to how like Jack's early body of visualizations like hit and resonated really well with a specific audience and then there was like a product set that aligned with that audience I mid-flight realized that there was an audience for my work that was like very interested and I started getting in February or March people were requesting in comments to things like hey you should make a book and I was like why would I make a book about memes and that those requests continued to the point where people were dming me telling me that they would give me money for the book that I hadn't made any public comments on making um so I just figured it out I made it and then self-published sold over a thousand copies now but it was kind of the like building in public and like updating people on your journey and like I think for for some people they are able to formulate a plan and then execute towards that plan and then iterate on it in as they go and I think for myself the path was more like iterate on things find a thing that people respond positively to and then continue to go down that rabbit hole and then eventually you will find ways to productize it right and I think I definitely could create like more businesses on top of this thing um so it's like the the body of work I'm calling like can you imagine which is the title of the book but it's like oh you can make a course called it you can imagine right um there's like kind of all these different ways you could take it I think for right now I am more focused on just like putting good out and like yes every once in a while people will be like oh I want you to like make a product and you can make some revenue on it but I'm not in my current state like wanting to become like a person that's like making courses and stuff I also think like it's very diff like a lot of the principles of communicating and design are things that Jack actually teaches indirectly with VV um just putting a satirical lens on it is a very weird approach that I don't think most people would do and that stuff's hard to teach too like the like that that that very unique voice I was going to ask you to tee up some of your fine art background too because I think that is like a differentiat and almost the opposite of um you know how a lot of people well not the opposite necessarily but when we met in person and talked about your background this idea of you know I view this stuff as art that kind of is on the bleeding edge of being accepted as art you know it's like this a very very cutting social commentary that in my mind if you filled a physical space with this stuff and people went in to have an experience it would be it would create incredible conversations reactions and that's what art is supposed to do and that's you know if you could speak a little bit about your background in that world I think that would be good context too yeah I I good good call out so I studied both business and art in University and part of the art program that I went through was you had to put on basically a thesis exhibition which was a body of work right and I think a lot of designers just use that I was like oh I'm going to go do like photo stuff or I'm going to do you know they're trying to like map it towards what they're going to do for their full-time work maybe I should have done that but I didn't and here we are um the concept I started like pulling at was like What if and this is 20 this was 2016 2017 for Contex with I was noticing that from like 2010 to 2016 the rate of decay of viral content had like exponentially increased so like troll f in like 2007 or whatever was a meme that lived for like 3 years or four years right and then by the time it was 2015 it was like maybe a couple days to a week and then now it's like six hours and it's irrelevant right um and so the work that I did the thesis was like what if there was a person or like a collective that was tasked with archiving mimetic digital content in a physical context as fast it was as it was being created and so I had basically the whole gallery to myself I had like a graveyard of Dead memes so it's like literally AstroTurf and then a bunch of like tombs and then I had a harambe shrine that was about eight feet tall and there was like an enal Loop plane and then there was a physical Tinder interface that had like three framed photo photos on the right and then a giant pile of people's faces printed out on the left and then I had like the that boy frog like popping out of the wall and like I had like real bricks and stuff so it looked like he yeah so stuff like that um which I that work was incredibly not it's well received on in some instances like people that understood like art as an institution were like this is really thought-provoking it's creating really interesting conv Sation and then you had people that are like less familiar with art and they're like putting memes in a gallery is an art like the fact that you're here talking about it makes it seem like it probably is though um but ultimately that work like installation heavy 3D work um is just very difficult to do unless you basically with art you have to like fully commit to like being an artist and the only acceptable job with within that Community is being a art Professor but if you try to like go corporate and then you're like I'm also an artist it's like you're not really committed to Art so um I kind of put it on hold which tabled it then went the full corporate route and then I somehow fell back into it I think like it's several Degrees of Separation away from that now um but I'm cooking on a few things that might try to like bring me back into that space can I ask a followup question to Jack I mean that was really insightful what you just said there but I'm curious to hear Jack's take on what an artist is because I feel like you have a lot of overlap in the same things that saen just said there about the the kind of purist artist um like idea but then you also worked on creative stuff but now clearly you have been ice all along you know so I'm I'm just curious what you think about about that it's I mean it's a weird everything sain said resonates with me too this idea of like you either are or you aren't and that's I mean it's a hard thing to qualify and I don't even know if I I don't even know if I agree with it but I definitely feel it if that makes sense like you you have obligations you want to make things that are not necessarily immediately commercially viable so that that's like in the artart camp but I would also think this like the internet as a canvas changed a lot of that too it's like there's this inherent conversation happening from zero on the internet whereas maybe this like entrenched understanding of what art is is like you have to make this stuff then you have to get somebody to represent you and you have to get represented by this institution eventually and that gives you credibility to go to the next in institution and the next institution and that's we could get in a whole uh long conversation about this idea of like the centralized version of art versus the decentralized version of art right someone like s built a massive captive audience of people that want to see the next expression of an idea that he has I would 100% stand in a room and debate that that is Art because like you have a captive audience that you are creating things from your imag ation and that they appreciate um but then you can take that same argument go when sa's working on the Square app Is that ah it's like uh kind of you know like you're creating you're pulling something out of your brain to create something that enables something to happen but maybe like the very direct you know functionality of that thing makes it not I've been using this line on podcast recently where as a designer you're trying to answer a question question and as an artist you're trying to ask a question so whatever the output of the thing is like if it falls more in one camp or the other that's like a loose mental model for figuring like sending money to your friend that like sold you a TV that's a design exercise right yeah making a piece of media that gets people to question their relationship with technology is an an artistic exercise so this is all memes and you know this is all language and abstraction but that's how I've at least come to terms with what I'm doing in either scenario I think part of it too is like you said with answering versus asking a question it's like output looks to the untrained eye basically identical for my ccal work and my non- ccal work right right but intent behind creation it's like when I'm working I'm trying to make something that is useful solves a customer need like Falls within a bunch of like compliance constraints and you know there's all these there's all these factors and then saying like what if you could preview your baby with AI on Tinder it's like one that's a joke and then two I think it's like yeah like it when you I very intentionally did not provide any additional context on anything I shared because you would just watch people debate in the comments or people have told me they would just screenshot it and then be like talking with the people and like that seems to be what like art does or at least like comedy too like I maybe I'm not an artist or I'm more of a comedian I don't know it's like Weird Al is a musician but he satirizes songs right and so I think there's like a little bit but I would also consider him an artist so um yeah I don't know I think that's a good that's a good summary the asking versus answering yeah and this is like a bad analogy too but the Seinfeld observational comedy you know like the thing that every Seinfeld episode opens with to me there's some connection there between those things like You observe something in happening in the world and then you create this thing that pokes at that uh absurdity of that event or that idea but all of this stuff I think ultimately is like the labeling of everything is unhelpful anyway it's like you're making something that is that you're enjoying doing people are enjoying consuming and it seems like you found a a great balance between those two things and that's also like a there's something to that separation that makes both parts of it sustainable too like you can kind of Escape one thing to do the other and vice versa um and you've been doing these every day right every day for since January 3rd incredible man yeah and that that I think uh if you could speak a little bit to how you get in the head space or how that how they pop up every day because that's I've been in that mode and out of that mode and once you're out of it it's very hard to get back in it yeah it's a it's a chaotic head space to be in I'll I'll say that much um so I think like there are there are times where like so I was having a conversation with a friend this morning almost like a visual chat GPT to people I don't know now so people will just send me like feature requests with no context right so like I have no I've like never met someone and they're like uber hot boox option blah blah blah like they just send me prompts which is very strange um but there's that and there have been a few times where it's like that is really good like can I use that and they're like yeah for sure um and then I think when you're in that head space as you described everything becomes idea fodder um where it's like uh when I was flying home uh we were we had a layover in LAX and we were like running through the airport because our flight was like we were super close on making our next flight and there were other people like running with us and they were being like very aggressive and like cutting people off and stuff and I was like what if you had to like fight people and then like that was the United option to like fight someone um or I'm trying to think of another like good example of this um yeah I think I think it's like part of it is just like experiencing life events that puts you in the head space and then I think the other part of it is um literally just brute forcing it where it's like I'm going to make something and I don't know what it's going to be and usually you just like get through a couple of like not very good like versions and then you get to something that's all right um and then I also have a few like friends that I use as like the litness test where it's like I'll text it to a couple people that are like in product and like design that whole world and then a few people that are outside of it and the goal is ideally to get overlap on both but you always got to get it on people that are outside of that sphere in my opinion because I think that means it's like more accessible um I did a a nest spouse lock feature where it's like you can like make it so your spouse can't change the Heat or the AC and um someone dm'd me and they're like my mom saw this on my coffee like that in your book and they like bought a coffee because they thought that was so funny right and it's like I think it's really easy in the tech world like when you're in it you just think about like everyone it's very much like a it's like a hive mind and everyone thinks the exact same but I'm trying to like pull myself out of that and more just think about the people that actually use a lot of the stuff that we're making which a lot of those people aren't even familiar with like ethereum as a concept right so um trying to abstract a lot of that away I I love how you said idea F so I actually did have a follow-up question on that is like how much of that is tied to the dopamine hits you get from going viral because what I mean by that is when you obvious I'm not saying that's the purpose of what you're doing but obviously when you launch something you're like okay this is going to do numbers and like like when you mentioned earlier like oh a thousand in the first so minutes you know this is gonna go nuclear right yeah it's like but there does seem to be I say from my personal perspective is like I know when you mentioned idea f it just hit me totally because when I started getting a lot more into Twitter literally everything became content because for me at initi I'm like dude I think this could go vir right it's like kind of sick but I don't know if that's how you think about it at all yeah I think I think it's like jokes and if they resonate well then the joke will likely be more well received by more people I think however I have kind of told myself from the like I had a couple that went like like wildly viral and I was like not everything's G to be like this that's totally fine like if I think it's funny or if like friends think it's funny that's enough for me and an example is like I did pagro Duty concept which Pedro duty is a tool for developers to get notified if there's like an on call request and they need to fix something uh and I made like a pag Duty notification that if you don't respond in 15 minutes It'll Call Your Girlfriend um and like my developer friends were like that's amazing and then a lot of people were like what is this um or I had a a phase early on where every Monday I would make like riffs on Mike's Hard Lemonade Concepts um so I had like Mike's hard shell tacos Mike's Hard Rock Cafe um Mike's Hard Hat Mike's hardboiled eggs but it got like I thought it was the funniest thing ever like me and a few of my friends were like this is hilarious but it got to the point like 12 weeks in where people were damming me and they're like please stop doing this so I think like I for it to be sustainable like I need to be having fun with it and so I think initially I was really like hooked on like oh my gosh how many people are like this like how many people and then you pretty quickly realize that that's not sustainable and you kind of have to just like separate and like focus on execution it's like I don't have enough time in a day to be constantly like looking at that stuff so um but yeah it's definitely I think it's like a right of passage like I'm sure Jack and you and B have all appr experien this where it's like this inflection point where you go from like I'm a small account that has like a few hundred people or a few thousand people and then all all a sudden it goes like it's like gas on a fire it starts going up really fast um and it's like it's a fun wild ride but I think you know you ride it up and then just kind of like readjust and get used to it it's a weird thing to get used to but you do get used to it no I agree I think huberman actually Andrew huberman talks about this in love his episodes it's like social feedback that do me get from social feedback it actually the the diminish returns is faster with that than almost any other type of dopamine hit like caffeine continually like every morning I have caffeine if it's I still want it the next day it feels good right exactly you got that fresh Red Bull there I love me some RB J got that Kirkland and uh the social actually is because it is such I mean literally it's just tied to number right it's like the total hedonistic treadmill is like you start going oh what I need one I need this to hit 1,000 I'm like need to hit 10,000 but that actually just legit just diminishes whereas you go for run funs you do caffeine these other activities which boost your dopamine they do not diminish as much as social so I'm totally on board with you on not only do you get used to it it really doesn't even like it's just not even a thing like and how you said is like you don't want your audience to dictate what you want to do right yeah yeah I think I think you don't want your audience to dictate what you want to do I think um my audience definitely expects something pretty specific from me now I've definitely niched myself down I have like thought about that I was like What if I just like sto what would happen um I think there's this idea that everyone is the main character in their own story right and so it's like this huge deal if like any one of us decided to just like stop but like the world would keep turning and like within a month or a couple weeks like it'd be like people would have forgotten about it which like is kind of comforting in a way where it's like it's a a big deal but it's also not a big deal at all um so I think like having that having that perspective and like not taking yourself too seriously is part of what has kept me sane and kept me like able to do it for as long as I've been doing it right yeah saen I think related to that we talked just before the show about some of the things we might touch on and we kind of just touched on it there about doing this daily and I think in your Twitter bio it literally says new ideas daily which I'm just curious like how long that's been going on before Twitter even just is that just something you've practiced for a long time and kind of second part to that is you talked about the kind of Merit of doing stuff daily or like these 100 Day projects which I've seen quite a lot of a few other friends have done like a challenge to themselves like whether it's posting online creating a Tik Tok video going to the gym whatever else it is I'm just curious like why have there been other ones that you've done related to this yeah yeah so I I had a professor in college where we had to do a 100 day project and then we had to make a Zen about it and I made the mistake of deciding that I was going to try to eat at a different place and document it every day for 100 days and so by the end it was like me eating at different Gap eating at different like gas stations it was so janky but like super fun um but and like I kind of went insane through that project but like other people were like I'm going to design one thing I'm like it was very it was like very tame and then I was like I'm just going to like go to 100 and like see if we can sustain it um I think with 100 Day projects it's I think it's like a couple weeks to a month to like really form a new habit but I think if you form that have it over the first month and then continue executing on it for like two more months it's it's like it becomes like breathing in a lot of ways like the first couple months of doing what I'm doing now is like really really hectic and like really chaotic and now it's like oh okay I need to like make something for tomorrow and they like spend like 15 minutes like get it figured out um and I think whether you like however you set up your accountability M Matrix like however you set up your accountability for that is up to you I decided to just like post every day I think like having some verifiable like proof that you did do it is like this is I think why part of why dual lingo is so successful right cuz you like want to keep that street going um but I think there's Merit to it for any number of reasons like for physical fitness obviously it's great I think for like learning something new it's great I think for experimenting with something new and validating validating whether or not it's like a good idea um 100 100 days is not an inconsequential time amount of time but it's also enough that you could do three of them in one one year right so if you wanted to test out like three different content formats or you wanted to test out like three different marketing strategies or three different businesses or three different like types of working out um it's a framework that's like worked for me um and yeah I've seen it work work for other people too but I think like I it's like longer than just forming the Habit which I think is really helpful because it's like you you you get you get that behavior to be like a normal part of your routine but then I also think you start to see the rewards of that behavior because things compound and I think like the first you know month or so of compounding is like pretty insignificant but then couple months in you're like who okay this is like really taken off um ideally and if not you can just can it and try something else somebody in this chat made have made a graphic about that called This is pointless I don't know if I don't know if the listeners are familiar with that that graph but I think there's something really like the interesting overlap too is it's like adjacent to what you're doing every day professionally but it's also a way to sort of unshackle yourself from the uh requirements of that uh situation too which I think a lot of people that kind of crack that balance it's you're not doing a complete content context switch you know to like you're not working on computers all day and then like knitting or you know weaving baskets or something like using your your very highly developed skill in a slightly different context yeah that gives you this massive return because you put it you know can put it out on the internet and anybody can look at it that to me is a yeah that's like the it's a massive cheat code and the just design as a practice even if nobody looked at had that stuff on the internet for a 100 days you would have this body of work that you could take to a job interview or share with somebody one-on-one and you have just these all these reps that made you a better designer and I think like that like cross communication between the passion project or the thing that you're doing outside of your work time in inverted commer um benefiting what you do for work like even the technical things that you're learning to pour over the different styles from this app to that app to this like makes you more competent outside of that context too which I think that feedback loop is another thing that and this may not be true for you s but that definitely was the case for me I was like you know even if this doesn't resonate at the scale I'm hoping it does I'm still sharpening my skills to use you know 9 to5 or whenever it was I was working yeah well I think it's like I I really know now now how to present things in a context where you're getting only the absolutely required information and like getting it in the simplest way possible so a lot of it's like if you try to present something in a way that will resonate with people for a couple hundred days like ideally you're going to get a little bit better at it and at the very worst like you're at least going to get better technical chops right like you learn keyboard shortcuts you learn like presentation you learn framing like yeah I think um the idea of my career has like all of these ingredients and I took like one ingredient which is like what if this was funny and you drop it in like I think thinking about passion project side projects in that sense where it's like you don't need it to be this like massive shift where it's like oh I'm gonna go become a professional basket Weaver it's like if you if you enjoy what you do for work somewhat or if there's a component of what what you enjoy doing for work identify the components that you don't like and try to remove those or if you can't identify things that you do like and see if you can basically insert them right so it's I'm a big comedy fan outside of all of this and so it's like what if I just like did that in this instance um and then you just pulled the thread I think yeah there's an even like the thing that's even more interested to me about this is the like comedy or a joke like making someone laugh is basically the ultimate Epiphany it's like the the the recognition of Truth this like incredible transference of energy when you've created something that just like instantly makes someone laugh and you've like that is the the Pinnacle of communication probably you know like I'm trying to think of a better vehicle for the amount of energy that's transferred it's like humor is you know career for example is like rocketed off that too is yeah there's something really like fundamentally true about somebody laughing at something you made like there's no you don't have to debate it you don't have to like explain it it's funny or isn't and you get Scott Adam has I Scott Adams has something the Dilbert comic obviously a little bit controversial for various things he said in the past but he has something exactly like you said he's like the purest and hardest thing to do obviously he's a he's a comic he's a draw as Comics right or Drew dilber for two decades he said the hardest thing to do when you're creating content is to get somebody to physically do something so if they're they're turtling laughing that's a physical manifestation of this way you're describing right the energy transference and he also says if they write back to you so if somebody takes the time to write an email or response that is like yeah physically you're getting some to do something so like like you get it me like sa when you get all those replies in your tweets on the satirical app things that's like that's a physical manifestation of oh you made somebody like I have to put on their thumbs and like type something into this box right so uh I I when you're saying that just I just remember Scott Adams talking about all the time like oh yeah great measure and I think like funny business leads to Serious Business where it's like if if um if to Jack's point the like the best way to like transfer one of the strongest like energy transfers or whatever between people is like making someone laugh I think it's also one of the fastest ways to remove like social barriers so it's like oh this person like makes me laugh like yeah I'll you know like it it makes it very easy to have informal conversations um and so that's I think that's one of the very surprising side effects is like one I was surprised that the growth was as much as it is but also it basically like took down all barriers to like oh I want to DM this person like I can oh this person follows me I didn't realize that right like um it just opens up a lot of doors and all I was doing was like basically acting like a I became I became like a comic strip writer in a very non-traditional sense and like I didn't act permissionless appr that's great Point dude it's not non man it's 2023 like this is the medium right like you you're you're doing what dber or Bill Waton for covin and Hobbs did two decades ago or who did Garfield anyway the same idea right yeah DAV it kind of reminds me of the midwit curve too you know like on those ends you have like that's funny and then in the middle you have someone like explain the joke to me why is this funny it doesn't make sense actually this this this it's like you're having the worst experience of the world in the middle basically yeah that's that's pretty accurate for the replies because some people are like LOL and then you have other people that are like this isn't use well actually all the Midway curves that's all that's all LinkedIn replies yeah because I post I post the same stuff on LinkedIn and it's a it's a fun time yeah man dude you if you wrote about the LinkedIn versus Twitter that would be an incredible piece of like archaeological content have you made these things for LinkedIn too because that could be even another way of doing it yeah I did he did a cring I did a I did a LinkedIn cringe reaction and then I did a LinkedIn uh instead of the hiring tag it's firing and then I did uh LinkedIn um nepotism disclosure so it's like another character univers salary I saw salary as yeah well there was like an option to like discount apply where it's like oh all these people have applied it's like oh increase your odds of getting the job by applying at like a 20% discount oh my this class man you never run out of material as well that's the like so we talk like we've talked about media businesses a bunch of times on here and this idea of a media or like a commentary angle on culture being the most sustainable form of media like B sports for example never ever ever runs out of material because there's 50 games happening every single day and every player in well not every player but a player is doing something ridiculous multiple times a day there's always something to talk about well yes yesterday the New York Post shared that a Delta flight was forced into an emergency landing by passengers di diarrhea um and then in quotes this is a bio house haard so I was like all right I know what we're cooking up this week so wa you talk through your 100 days actually I had to pin because I didn't want to lose it was you said that the first 30 days were a bit chaotic for this so okay what do you mean cha I know you mentioned that you're creating like guess digital artifacts all the way through but like what what made it chaotic so one it was the reaction was like way more intense than I thought it would be right like one of the first things I posted had like 30 or 40,000 likes and then I was getting like a couple thousand followers a day and I was like what is going on um and then on top of that I now have this giant figma file that has all these past Concepts right when I started there was nothing so I was like okay how do I make one of these and I hadn't I hadn't figured out like what the templates were so like early on I sometimes do like two screens where it's like one screen to set up the like context and then almost like the punchline but also the actions are in the second screen I had never done that format so I was like maybe I experimented with that format and then there's like device framing so like sometimes the it's the top of the device other times it's the bottom the times it's centered so there were a lot of questions around presentation format that I was like going through as I was kind of building out this system um and then yeah the the like before I understood that you can just like ignore replies I was like oh man this is like really overwhelming um and then also yeah I think like I hadn't trained the muscle yet of like everything is an opportunity to like saiz the interface right um it's like a weird way to like train your brain um I think I've gotten to that point now but up until well that first month specifically it was just like really like working to try and make sure that I was like getting something out every day and that it was like good um but yeah and then also the there was like the the the fact check from Reuters and stuff like that where it's like you know there's just like no Playbook and you're like this this and then you're like it's satire it's protected by the First Amendment so it's yeah just like going going going through a lot of these like very strange experiences that I'm like there's no person that I can be like hey what happens when this happens yeah man I think like this is uh packing the simulation they call it I think this idea of like you found this very particular voice and format for commenting on what's happening in the world we love to see it incredible no no that's right we can go for a five more minutes or so but yeah TR you got any other questions I want to Pepper sh some more serious more serious business we talked about the funny can we can we talk in a couple minutes on the serious stuff you mentioned a bit about du lingo and the streaks feature could you just give us kind of like the Hall of Fame off top of your head right now some of the best app features you're an app Designer work can cash out what are some stuff that you're like oh that's good like whoever did that respect like what are some of the Hall of Fame app features ever created whether that's vity or engagement so I think there's like I mean this is like a several hour conversation if it's properly done I think there's like who are some people that are building interesting apps right now and there's uh Benji I think it's Benji Taylor he's building family which is a crypto wallet um the interaction the level of care and attention to the interaction design is like Second To None it's super good um they used to have an app called honk which was basically real-time DMS between two people and the chat bubbles would like scale um that just great great design and pretty thoughtful like roll out out too um I think to the Dual lingo point and this is like not answering your question but this is kind of like a tangent that I think is important and interesting um du lingo has the bird right Duo and if you look like 10 years ago that bird was like really creepy looking but uh look it up on your own time it was wild um and then now it's this like cute little character that guides you through the whole experience and I think they've kind of mastered all of the feedback loops that you need to like get someone to go through their first lesson and then like commit to doing another lesson and then they give you like a free Taste of the premium product like it's very it's very thoughtfully designed and I think they are they have the luxury of being in a great Market SL like a good thing to sell like it's very harmless to like sell people on learning a new language right I think if those patterns are pulled into other applications it could get pretty weird and pretty dark um but something that I think is interesting about dualingo so they have that bird right and then Pokemon which is Nintendo's IP Pokemon go was obviously a huge success but then they had this sleep app that was also Pokemon right and that also blew up and I think we're at the early stages of existing media companies with massive IP being able to insert their IP as almost like the DU lingo bird where it's like oh a running app where Sonic the Hedgehog can like train you right like Sega could build that so I think like Duo took 10 years to build up this like Mo of Ip um but I could almost see that happening from like existing entr trench players if they're able to get the tech right random thought John Palmer it's his weird little guy thesis that every successful app has a weird little guy if you understand this can you can you talk through this this is It's a tweet so John Palmer runs party Dow um but he tweeted like a few months ago like successful products have a weird little guy if you understand this and then like duing is a great example of that I don't think it's like a clippy uh male chimp a clippy from back in the day yeah maale chimp has their chimp so I don't think you it's like not like a necessary thing per se right but I think like the more complex a product and the more that a product has like an ongoing Journey that you're needing to like learn I think there are opportunities for things like that like the white labeling of uh features underneath different IP right this is like AI era stuff too where I want to hear a bedtime story in this voice or I want like my app to be skinned in this sop dog yeah when you sleep exactly it does feel like that though like especially man having kids you you really start to understand like how how much attachment there can be to IP that basically if you put it over the top of something you're trying to get somebody to do brush your teeth with this you know beige toothbrush no I'm not going to do that stick a Elmo on it or something you're in business yeah you're dud I love that well hold on so s there's a couple more threads I want to pull on this because I don't I don't once we got you I don't want to listen so like the tnder swipe one of the greatest app like you know interactions ever right what else is on that level to you like what that type of uh that type of interaction with an app yeah I mean I'm trying to think let me let me let me open up my phone look at some stuff I think uh so you're actually like are you asking like pure interaction design or you asking like features uh anything of that nature where just like because it obviously the Swip is so ingrained with Tinder right and it was such a genius interaction Jack are you saying the vertical swipe I was saying vertical scr well I was gonna open I was gonna say like infinite feed insan which is is that is insane and then Tik Tok doing INF basically well that's like a Biblical that's like a BC you know what they call AD BC Bor after yeah yeah no that's a big difference Raa you got a cut face when he infinite scr he was like like orgasmic he like you said infinite scroll dude it's like crawling out of the [ __ ] water the slug thing you know for for real though um yeah I mean like I think like Tik Tok is insane because they won had like a algo that would get trained on your interactions and all you would do is swipe and it was like the first social app where you didn't need to follow anyone to have a good time but but you could also follow people and have a good time like wild um and then what the same about Tinder to be fair but I mean that was a long time ago but no yeah Tik Tok is Tik Tok takes takes the cake here man definitely thinking what else there is sa's scrolling my notifications is obviously the big Cas say Cash's got got to take a few few crowns along the way the tag the cash cash cash tag um being able to I mean just being able to Simply transfer funds right and then um they now have Bitcoin and stock trading too right and I think like the if you look at like a eade or like awab right like those those views are like very cumbersome and dense and then like you've got these very simple easy to parse like like charting on cash um and then yeah the idea like a cashtag is really interesting because it's like a separate identity layer that obviously is like a hashtag but works in a completely different context um trying to think if there's anything else off the Dome um I think in terms of like interaction patterns that well actually I guess this is like way way way way back but online offline just like little circles like Green Dot versus not Green Dot I think like I think it's wild that that came about and I think also wild the contexts that we use that in like if you had gone back to like first aim and be like one day when you sign in for work you're going to be able to see if all of your co-workers are online or not right like um I worked at Bloomberg and you had a Tim stamp of When you entered the building on your online thing if you're in or out of the building crazy I was going to say we referenced this already but the typing bubble too that's a crazy one yeah well no the typing typing bubble's crazy I think on slack it says who is typing which I think is like I remember my first job it's like you see the boss typing you're like oh or yeah starts stops start stops or you'll see like one person starts typing and it's like this person and this person are typing and then all of a sudden it's like a lot of people are typing they like oh god um yeah yeah it's all that stuff um I think like I think it's it's less about like what like what specific like interaction I think it's more or just like these tiny pieces of information that are revealed read receipts insane concept green bubble versus blue bubble and I met dude that is you just said signaling or like what it represents that's AA big that's literally worth probably hundred billion dollars to Apple like the switching cost of that if you were to do a back of the envelope on how much the green versus blue bubble is I think somebody did is like this is worth a100 billion to uh to uh to Apple and iMessage like this social network it's insane man but this is why you get so much uh good stuff out of the iMessage screen bro yeah there's a lot of work with there amazing all right any last question boys this has been amazing man thanks for breaking this for us great I think we I think we have to guest Sor back on for you remember when you said this would be like an hour's worth conversation of like we should just go through here are the 20 Greatest like internet interactions ever that's an episode right there that's a great shot I think I think you could also go pretty deep on like meme history but that' probably just be fun unless you that'd be a killer episode yeah that'd be a killer episode definitely saon anywhere we want to send people dude I know you got your book this is your chance to plug it here mate yeah yeah so first of all I'm on X formerly known as Twitter um and then also if that's not your style I'm on Instagram and Linkedin and it's going to be the same content just different reactions so don't expect a bunch of new stuff um and then yeah I have a book called can you imagine it is the first hundred Concepts and then 10 exclusive Concepts to the book and then there's like a intro section like a write up on each one so yeah uh get it for your coffee table or for a loved one's coffee table holidays around the corner it's a great gift um so yeah uh you can find that just on my x file um it's like there's a link in the bio yeah we'll link it in the bio in the show notes as well so people can go check out you can't miss it it's the cleanest mustache profile picture on the entire platform I just like it's just unbelievably wellmaintained and just like beautiful two years in the Mak there you go anyway thanks for coming on S we appreciate you man amazing work dud inred listeners all right cheers boys [Music] later oh",
